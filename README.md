# Unity-CellNoiseMap
Useful for creating diversity but flow wherever pixel values can correspond to an entity (Example: Population density, cities are the center of a cell and population decreases as you move away, but can grow as you approach another)

There are 2 variables that mess with the Noise Map and should be played with to find the desired output. They are also invertable

Fe to use and I tried to keep it simple and able to be accessed for any purpose (within Unity)
